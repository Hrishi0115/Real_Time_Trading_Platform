# Real-Time Trading Platform

## Objectives

The aim of this application is to provide a seamless, real-time trading experience, allowing users to engage in trading activities as they happen. It will include:

1. Intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI): a user-friendly interface that makes it easier for users to navigate and perform actions. The GUI will be a key component, offering a clear and aesthetically pleasing view of the market and trading tools.

2. Real-Time Candlestick Generation: the platform should display candlestick charts that update in real-time, reflecting the latest market data. This feature will help traders analyze market trends and make informed decisions.

3. Trade Placement: Users should be able to place trades directly from the platform. This includes buying and selling assets (short) with a simple and intuitive process.

4. Stop Loss and Take Profit Controls: the application will provide tools to set and visualize stop loss and take profit orders. Initial ideas for this include using boxes to represent these controls, providing a visual and interactive approach to managing trades, i.e. can draw boxes (red and green) to show the boundaries of take profit/loss and to show what area of PnL you are in while involved in a trade.

## Key Components

These are my initial ideas - subject to change as project progresses.

1. Frontend: Likely will develop using a modern JavaScript framework, e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js, combined with a charting library, e.g., D3.js, Chart.js, Highcharts, for real-time candlestick charts and interactive features (might want to do candlestick/chart components from scratch given my unique aims with them)

2. Backend: Will develop using a robust backend framework, e.g., Node.js (Express), Django, or Flask to handle user requests, trade executions, and data processing. It will interface will various APIs for real-time market data and order execution - likely to employ easy-to-use frameworks like FastAPI for prototyping but ideally will migrate to more performative languages/frameworks like Golang, Node.js, Elixir with Phoenix Framework - given that this is a trading application (real-time data processing, performance, reliability, scalability)

3. Websockets for Real-Time Data: To ensure real-time updates, especially for candlestick charts and live trade execution feedback, WebSockets or a similar protocol should be used

4. Database: A reliable database (such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis) to store user data, trading history, settings and other essential information

5. Security: Strong security measures, including encryption, secure authentication (OAuth, JWT), and protection against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) are essential for any financial platform.

6. API Integration: integration with market data providers and brokers through their APIs to fetch live data and execute trades

7. Testing and Compliance: Ensuring the application is throughly tested for bugs and performance issues, as well as compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., financial regulations, GDPR, etc.)
