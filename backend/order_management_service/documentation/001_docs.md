Great! Since you've decided to begin with the **Order Management Service**, the best next step is to define the core requirements and API structure. Here’s a roadmap for moving forward:

### 1. **Define Functional Requirements**
   
These requirements should focus on the key features and behaviors the Order Management Service must support:
   
- **Placing Orders**: The ability to create new buy/sell orders.
- **Modifying Orders**: Allow users to modify orders that haven’t been executed.
- **Canceling Orders**: Enable users to cancel pending orders.
- **Order Validation**: Ensure there are sufficient funds, and validate order type and market data (if applicable).

### 2. **Design API Endpoints**

Design RESTful API endpoints to expose this functionality. Here’s a high-level outline of the core endpoints:

#### a. **Place an Order**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /orders`
   - **Payload**:
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "string",
       "instrument_id": "string",
       "order_type": "BUY/SELL",
       "quantity": "integer",
       "price": "decimal",
       "order_mode": "LIMIT/MARKET"
     }
     ```
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "order_id": "string",
       "status": "SUCCESS/FAILURE",
       "message": "string",
       "reserved_funds": "decimal"
     }
     ```

#### b. **Modify an Order**
   - **Endpoint**: `PUT /orders/{order_id}`
   - **Payload** (optional fields can be updated):
     ```json
     {
       "quantity": "integer",
       "price": "decimal"
     }
     ```

#### c. **Cancel an Order**
   - **Endpoint**: `DELETE /orders/{order_id}`
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "CANCELED/FAILURE",
       "message": "string",
       "refunded_funds": "decimal"
     }
     ```

#### d. **Get Order Status**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /orders/{order_id}`
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "order_id": "string",
       "status": "PENDING/EXECUTED/CANCELED",
       "details": {
         "user_id": "string",
         "instrument_id": "string",
         "quantity": "integer",
         "price": "decimal"
       }
     }
     ```

### 3. **Database Design**
Since you’ve already established your PostgreSQL database, you’ll need to ensure the `orders` table structure supports the API. You should also integrate order management with related tables, such as **portfolios** (for funds checks) and **transactions** (to log order activity).

Here’s a minimal schema for the `orders` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  instrument_id UUID NOT NULL,
  order_type VARCHAR(4) CHECK (order_type IN ('BUY', 'SELL')),
  order_mode VARCHAR(6) CHECK (order_mode IN ('LIMIT', 'MARKET')),
  quantity INT CHECK (quantity > 0),
  price DECIMAL(18, 4) CHECK (price >= 0),
  status VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'PENDING',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 4. **Write Business Logic**

You’ll need backend logic to manage these actions. A few key considerations:
   
- **Order Placement**:
   - Validate if the user has sufficient funds (for BUY orders).
   - For **LIMIT** orders, set them as **PENDING** until they are matched with a trade.
   - For **MARKET** orders, immediately mark them as **EXECUTED** with the latest price.

- **Order Modification**:
   - Only allow modifications if the order is still in **PENDING** state.
   - Update the reserved funds or quantity.

- **Order Cancellation**:
   - Release any reserved funds for **BUY** orders when canceled.

### 5. **Implement API with a Framework**
Select a framework you are comfortable with. Based on your stack:

- **Node.js/Express** (for JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Spring Boot** (for Java)
- **ASP.NET Core** (for C#)
- **Flask/FastAPI** (for Python)

Start by creating basic endpoints and stubbing out the logic, adding full functionality incrementally.

### 6. **Unit Testing**

Write unit tests for each API endpoint to ensure correctness. You can use testing frameworks such as:
   
- **Jest** (for Node.js)
- **JUnit** (for Java)
- **XUnit** (for .NET)
- **PyTest** (for Python)

### Summary of Next Steps:
1. **Finalize API Requirements** – Confirm which features are essential for your MVP.
2. **Database Adjustments** – Ensure the database schema can handle order placement, modification, and cancellation.
3. **Create API Skeleton** – Write the base code for the REST API endpoints.
4. **Add Business Logic** – Implement validation, fund checks, and order management workflows.
5. **Test & Refine** – Unit test the API for correctness and edge cases.
